## Overview

**Golden Cross** and **Death Cross** compares long-term trends and short-term trends to indicate a bull or bear market. A **Golden Cross** occurs when a short-term moving average crosses over a long-term moving average, indicating a bull market. On the other hand, a **Death Cross** is the exact oppposite of a **Golden Cross**, indicating a bear market.

In the demo below, we show cases where the **Golden Cross and Death Cross** might be a good indicator and cases where it fails.
