## What is the Yield Curve?

The Yield Curve depicts the relationship between interest rates (yields) of fixed-income debt instruments and its maturities. In this case, it specifically points to the U.S. Treasury debt securities, which are regarded as risk-free. It provides critical insights, not only reflecting the current federal funds target rate but also revealing market expectations for future interest rate movements and economic conditions. Hence, it is considered as one of the most important indicators in finance.
