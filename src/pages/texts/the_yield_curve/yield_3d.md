## The Yield in a 3D Perspective

The curve yield is often shown as a 2D plot, but it can also be represented in 3D. More specifically, for a given date in the x-axis, the y-axis represents the maturity of the bond, and the z-axis represents the yield. As a 3D plot, when looking at a specific date (x-axis), a flat or regressing curve can be seen as a flat or inverted yield curve, respectively.
