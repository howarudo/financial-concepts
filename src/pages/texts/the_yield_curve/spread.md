## The Spread

As inverted yield curves are considered as a precursor to economic recession, the spread, the difference between long-term and short-term yields, is a critical indicator. From the graph below, we can see that comparing the 3-month, 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year yields, yields tend to grow upwards, and inverted yield curves are rare.
