## Types of Yield Curves

Yield curves generally trend upwards, higher yields for bonds with later maturity. This is due to inflation corroding the value for fixed-income returns. Yield curves that show this trend are called **Normal Yield Curve**, while yield curves that show similar yields for all maturities are called **Flat Yield Curve**, and yield curves with long-term bonds having lower yield are called **Inverted Yield Curves**.
