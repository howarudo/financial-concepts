## Moving Average Plots
#### On the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis

In this demo, MVA (simple moving average) of 30 days and 200 days are implemented. **Golden Cross**es are shown as **green**-dashed lines while **Death Cross**es are shown as **red**-dashed lines. From the figure below, **Golden Cross and Death Cross** successfully indicated the downfall of the market on 2007-2008. It also indicated the recovery of the stock market in Jun 2009.

However, it also had false indicators on Jun 2010 where it predicted a bear market, Sep 2007 where it predicted a bear market. This shows that the model might be too sensitive and a longer short-term moving average has to be implemented.
