## Overview

**Event Study Analysis** is a statistical method to evaluate the impact of an event on a time-series data. In this case, it is used to evaluate whether an event has a significant impact on a stock by analyzing its abnormal return.

In this demo, we will explore an artificial case where after an event date, a company's stock price has a significant abnormal return. We will use the Event Study Analysis to statistically evaluate the impact of the event on the stock price.

## Assumptions
**Event Study Analysis** is based on the following assumptions:

1. **Efficient Market Hypothesis**: The stock market is efficient, and the stock price reflects all available information. In other words, the impact of an event will be immediately reflected in the stock price.

2. There are no other events or factors that could affect the stock price during the event window.

3. The event is unexpected and has a significant impact on the stock price.
