From the figure above, the Abnormal Returns have stayed under the $3\sigma$ range except for during the event date. This is also reflected on the numerical value of the p-value. As $p < 0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the mean abnormal returns are significantly different from zero. Hence, there was a significant event happening that has affected the stock price.
