Before the event, the $\beta_0$ is set to $\beta_0 = 200$, and after the event, $\beta_0$ is set to $\beta_0 = 400$. By doing this, a stock jump is simulated at the event date, $t_{event}$. In this case, **event window** is set to $[t_{event} - 2, t_{event} + 3]$. From the figure above, during this event window, a significat jump in stock price and returns is observed.
