## Demo

In this demo, we explore an aritificial case where a stock price at a given date $t$ is determined by the following equation:

$$
P_t = A \times \epsilon_t + \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times t
$$

where $P_t$ is the stock price at time $t$, $A$ is the noise' amplitude, $\epsilon_t$ is a noise term that follows a normal dsitribution $\epsilon_t \sim N(0, 1)$, $\beta_0$  is the price at day 0, and $\beta_1$ is the slope of the stock price.
